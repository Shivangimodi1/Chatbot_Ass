# Chatbot Web Application

Welcome to the **Chatbot Web Application**! This is a simple, interactive web app that allows users to chat with a bot by asking three demo questions: "Hi", "What is your name?", and "What can you do?". The chatbot responds with predefined answers, providing a sample of a working chatbot interface.

## Features

- **Simple Chat Interface:** Users can send messages to the chatbot and receive instant responses.
- **Predefined Demo Questions:** Currently, the chatbot is programmed to answer three simple questions:
  - **Hi**: Greets the user.
  - **What is your name?**: Bot responds with its name.
  - **What can you do?**: Bot explains what it can do.
  
## Tech Stack

The following technologies were used to build this chatbot web app:

### Frontend
- **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Used to create the dynamic and interactive chat interface.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the chat window, note box, and other elements to make the application visually appealing.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend server.
- **HTML5**: Standard markup language used for structuring the web app.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used to build the backend server.
- **Express.js**: A Node.js framework used to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Sequelize**: ORM used to interact with the database (even though demo data is hardcoded for now).
- **MySQL** (optional): Database for storing data (although for now, we are using mock data).
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables securely.
